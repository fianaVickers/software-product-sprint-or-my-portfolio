      <p style=" color: lightgray; font-size: 12pt;">
        My name is Fiana Vickers. My first name is pronounced 
         like (Fee-Ahh-Na), unlike the green ogre! I was born
         in Tallahassee Florida and at age five my family and
         I relocated to Titusville Florida, which is about
         15-minutes from the Kennedy Space Center. After 
         taking an AP computer science principals course in my 
         Junior year of High School, I have been enamored with
         programming and computational software engineering 
         practices. As an aspiring Software Engineer, I plan
         to graduate in the Spring of 2023 from the University
         of Florida as a Computer Engineering Major. When I
         am not busy studying, I keep myself occupied by
         spending time with friends and family, sketching, 
         reading, and playing video games – specifically Overwatch.</p>

       Children's Mathematical Java Application
        </p>

        <p style=" color: lightgray; font-size: 12pt;">
       	This project kickstarted my computer science interests with
        it being my first introduction to programming. Within a two-week
        sprint, I developed a mobile application aimed at improving young 
        children’s math skills. It implemented fun characters and quick 
        objectives in the format of addition and subtraction equations, 
        to keep the attention span of its’ audience.
